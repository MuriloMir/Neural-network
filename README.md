# neural-network
Here there is a module called neuralnetwork.d, it contains functions and classes which you can use to build your own feed-forward sigmoid network.

There is also a program called networkCreator.d, which allows you to draw the network with the mouse, then you press Enter so it generates the source code of the whole network. In order to generate the source code it uses the tools inside the module neuralnetwork.d, therefore you need to download both files, and the dependencies file, in order to compile everything.
